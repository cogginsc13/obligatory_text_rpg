A project just for fun and learning.

This game is something I'm working on as a way to practice learning Python.  Open to all critiques, suggestions, and guidance.

The game works as follows:

The player selects a class and is thrown into a story.
The story progresses linearly, but each new room is randomly chosen.  If the room has an enemy, it will be randomly selected.
Some rooms will have other challenges to overcome.
Players will have to defeat enemies through battle, solve other puzzles, collect items, and hopefully defeat the final boss.

Interaction is all based on rolling d6's.

Some of my next goals:
-creating different categories of items (health items, single-use weapons (i.e. stun grenade), stat boosting items)
-search function, based on rolling d6's
-categorizing weapons with damage types, giving enemies resistences and weaknesses
-creating special attacks that utilize strength and intelligence stats
-generating flavor text according to rooms and enemies present
